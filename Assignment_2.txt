Answer: 
-range(10) - from 0-10 with step count 1 by default
-Range(0,10)- from 0 to 10 with step count 1 by default
-Range(0,10,1)- from 0 to 10 with step count of 1 

12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.

Answer: -
	1) for i in range(1,11,1):
    	print(i)
	2) j=1
